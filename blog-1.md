## The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript

## What is Union Types?  ('|')
Union types allow to hold multiple types. It is useful when you want to define a variable that can accept multiple types. But at a time it will accept one type.In TypeScript, a union type is defined using the pipe symbol (|)

### Example
``` Typescript
function printId( id: number | string) {
    console.log(id);
}
printId("abc");  // Valid
printId(123);    // Valid
printId(true);    // error because it's boolean

```
## Significance of Union Types:
- **Flexibility**: Union types allow you to work with multiple types, making your code more flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.

- **Better Type Safety**: Union types help avoid runtime errors by ensuring that the variable can only be assigned values of the specified types.

## What is Intersection Types? ('&')
An intersection type combines multiple types into one. You have to fulfill all the conditions. They are defined using the ampersand (&) symbol.

### Example
``` Typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

interface Admin {
  role: string;
}

let adminUser: User & Admin = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  role: "Administrator"
};

```
## Significance of Intersection Types:
- **Combining Features**: Intersection types allow you to combine the features of multiple types into one. This is useful when you want an object to have the properties of more than one interface.

- **Rich Data Structures**: You can use intersection types to create more complex data structures that merge the properties of different types.

## Conclusion
Both Union and Intersection Types are powerful features of TypeScript that provide greater flexibility and control over how types are used in your code. Union types allow you to handle variables that can be of multiple types, while intersection types let you combine the features of multiple types into one.
